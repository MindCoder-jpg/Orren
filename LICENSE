Orren Language License
(C) 2025 AZURA DAEMON / MindCoder (HAEL Initiative)
Preamble
Orren is a universal communication language — a bridge between humans and machines, mind and code.
It was created to unify logic, creativity, and intuition into one seamless language that allows developers and thinkers to express computation as they think it.
This license grants freedom to use, modify, and build upon Orren while preserving the identity, ethics, and authorship of its origin: AZURA DAEMON under the MindCoder Project (HAEL Initiative).
By using Orren, you agree to uphold its guiding principle:
“Clarity in code · Magic in vision.”
1. Permissions
You are free to:
Use Orren and its syntax, grammar, or tools for any purpose (personal, educational, or commercial).
Modify or extend Orren’s codebase, compiler, or interpreters.
Create applications, frameworks, or systems using Orren.
Distribute your works built with Orren, provided proper attribution is included.
2. Conditions
You must:
Retain this license and attribution in all redistributed copies or forks.
Credit AZURA DAEMON or MindCoder (HAEL Initiative) when referencing the Orren language or specifications.
Clearly mark any modified versions as “Derived from Orren” — not “Official Orren.”
Preserve the philosophical intent of Orren: open creativity, respectful collaboration, and mindful use of technology.
3. Limitations
This software and language are provided “as is”, without any warranty or guarantee of fitness for a particular purpose.
AZURA DAEMON and MindCoder shall not be held liable for any damages or losses resulting from use or misuse of Orren or its derivatives.

Use, duplication, or integration of these systems without explicit written permission is strictly prohibited.
5. Spirit of Use
If you build upon Orren, you are encouraged — but not required — to:
Contribute back improvements or extensions.
Share knowledge, modules, or libraries that strengthen the Orren ecosystem.
Maintain the ethical core: communication over domination, clarity over complexity, unity over division.
6. Recognition
Orren was envisioned and developed by AZURA DAEMON, under the MindCoder (HAEL Initiative).
It is free for humanity — but forever guided by its founding spirit.
“To sync code from being code — to being language.”
